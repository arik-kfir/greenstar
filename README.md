# greenstar

GreenSTAR is a personal financials management application, meant to be used as your own personal accountant - always there, ready to serve, and ready to save! Our vision for this application is that this will grow into the following mediums:

- Web application providing the full breath of functionality: exploration, reporting, and insights.
- Mobile application providing quick insights and helpful tips.
- Financial Assistant backed by an LLM for interacting with your data to derive smart insights from past financial behavior.

## Status

GreenSTAR is still a work-in-progress, and as such, should be considered in alpha status and not recommended for use.
